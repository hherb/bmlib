# Deliberate non-fixes — do not "fix" these

Each entry below was investigated and closed as correct. Reopening one wastes
a session. Entries marked "argued inline" carry their full reasoning as
comments in the named source file; the entry here is the pointer, not the
argument — write new entries in that shape, and put the argument where the
code is.

Split out of `HANDOVER.md` on 2026-08-09, which the register had grown to
dominate. `HANDOVER.md` is for what still needs doing; this file is for what
must not be re-done.

## Transparency

- **`_INDUSTRY_STEMS` and `_INDUSTRY_WORDS` must not be merged into one
  list**, and neither may be extended without re-running
  `scripts/sample_funder_names.py` against `tests/data/funder_names.json` —
  the corpus *removed* intuitive members (`pharma`, `biotech`) on measured
  false positives. Metric test:
  `tests/test_funder_matching.py::TestAgainstTheLabelledCorpus`.
- **`_is_industry_funder()` is deliberately not applied to COI prose**;
  `_INDUSTRY_COI_KEYWORDS` stays separate — org suffixes match far too
  freely in running text.
- **Every `analyze()` sub-step takes `_Analysis`, mutates it, and returns
  `None`** — one step threading a value while four mutate is the
  inconsistency that makes the next contributor guess. Pinned by
  `test_the_merge_applies_both_of_its_branches_to_one_list`.
- **The data-deposition rank-merge machinery** (`_DATA_LEVEL_RANK`,
  `note_data_level()`, `_DEPOSITION_DATABANK_LEVELS`) is argued inline in
  `transparency/analyzer.py`. Two rules: every producible level must be a
  key of the ranking or `note_data_level()` raises by design; the deposition
  list deliberately excludes reference-only databases (dbSNP, OMIM, RefSeq…).
  Three tests in `test_transparency.py` pin it.
- **Four more, each argued where it lives and each with a test naming it:**
  `TransparencySettings.filtering_enabled` / `max_concurrent_analyses` /
  `cache_results` are caller-owned orchestration hints, not dead code;
  `outcome_switching_detected` stays reserved and always `False` (kept in the
  schema so persisted results need no migration when detection lands); a
  PubMed record with no `<CoiStatement>` leaves `coi_disclosed` alone (absence
  means the publisher supplied none); and `<DataBankList>` accessions are
  validated as `NCT\d{8}` before becoming a URL, though an entry failing
  validation still counts as registered — registration is separate from
  followability.

## Positional stability

- **`Publication.pmcid`, `BaseAgent.__init__`'s `embedding_model`, and
  `TransparencyResult.unknown_reason` are each declared last** on their
  dataclass/signature — downstream projects construct positionally, and any
  other placement shifts every following argument silently. Pinned by
  `test_positional_construction_is_stable_across_versions`.

## db / llm / agents

- **PostgreSQL transaction nesting is detected from bmlib's own open-block
  count, not psycopg2's status**, keyed by *(thread, `id(conn)`)* — see
  CLAUDE.md for why both parts are load-bearing.
- **The Ollama raw `/api/tags` path re-implements httpx's safety defaults on
  purpose** (HTTP(S)-only scheme, bearer token stripped across cross-origin
  redirects, `"<word>:<digits>"` read as host:port). Each has a regression
  test naming it.
- **The JSON extractors prefer a whole span to a nested fragment in three
  places** (argued inline in `llm/utils.py`, `llm/json_repair.py`,
  `agents/base.py` — all guarding #33's silent truncation), **a fenced
  candidate wins on parse alone**, **`parse_json()` enforces `dict | list`**
  (a bare scalar raises → retry inside `chat_json()`), **`require_dict` has
  a third `bool` overload** (mypy does not expand `bool` into the two
  `Literal`s; CI runs ruff only, so nothing catches its removal), and
  **`salvage_json_fields()` bounds both passes with `RecursionError` caught
  wherever a candidate is decoded**. `iter_json_spans()` dedupes candidates by
  text, not position. Eleven tests pin these — seven in
  `test_json_extraction.py` (from `TestExtractJsonPrefersWholeSpans`) and four
  in `test_agents.py`.
- **`PerformanceMetrics.elapsed_time_seconds` reads `time.monotonic()`**,
  not the wall-clock timestamps it stores; `snapshot()` must copy the
  monotonic marks by hand (`init=False`). Model-inference and prompt-eval
  timers are deliberately omitted — no provider reports them through bmlib.
  Pinned by `test_elapsed_survives_a_wall_clock_step` and
  `test_snapshot_carries_the_monotonic_marks`.

## context_processor

- **The batcher measures the string it will actually send; it never assumes
  a size.** Three tempting arithmetic shortcuts each re-break
  `max_context_chars` the way upstream did; the invariant is
  `Batch.total_chars == len(_format_batch_content(batch, config))`.
  `estimate_item_size()` was deliberately not ported — it let the oversized
  decision disagree with the packing measurement.
- **Six more load-bearing "simplifications" refused**, each with a named test
  in `test_context_processor.py` / `test_llm_chunk_processor.py`: `_render()`
  substitutes in one regex pass (two-pass `.replace()` splices the batch into
  a query containing `{content}`); the package `__init__` reaches
  `llm_processor` through PEP 562 `__getattr__` (a plain re-export drags
  jinja2 into the LLM-free harness); `process()` keeps statistics in a local,
  not on `self`; `success_rate` cannot return 1.0 for a batch-less run that
  dropped everything; the recursion wraps results in `ConsolidatedItem`, not
  a tuple (what made upstream's `format_consolidated_item()` dead code), and
  `min_items_for_recursion` stopping at one result is correct; and
  `LLMChunkProcessor` renders with `str.replace`, not `str.format` (templates
  legitimately hold literal braces).

## fulltext — retrieval and JATS

- **`_JATSHandler.endElement` tests `in_figure or in_table_wrap` before any
  prose branch and routes on `in_caption`** — asking about the section first
  blanks the caption and renames the section; the same branch deliberately
  drops non-caption `<p>` inside figures/tables. Pinned by
  `TestJATSParserCaptionScoping` and
  `TestJATSParserUnsectionedBodyFurniture`.
- **NCBI's ID Converter is consulted *after* the Europe PMC search** (the
  search also carries the free-PDF URL) **but *outside* the search's
  `except`, in its own statement** — a search that raised is exactly when a
  second resolver is worth its request, and one enclosing handler would
  swallow the error before the converter was reached. A converter-discovered
  PMC ID is tried at Europe PMC even when the search said `inEPMC="N"`, since
  a stale flag is one reason the converter exists. Two tests in
  `test_fulltext_service.py` pin it, starting at
  `test_the_converter_is_consulted_when_the_search_itself_failed`.
- **`_fetch_ncbi_pmc()` raises on a reply with neither body nor abstract** —
  efetch answers a publisher-withheld article with a stub that is HTTP 200
  and parses cleanly; returned instead of raised, it becomes near-empty HTML
  labelled `content_kind="abstract"`. Pinned by
  `test_a_stub_with_no_article_raises` and
  `test_a_body_less_article_with_an_abstract_is_returned`.

## fulltext — importable on a core install (#64, PR #66)

**CLAUDE.md argues this one in full**, under "Optional dependencies guarded
at the call site". What it omits:

- **Both halves of the fix stay, and the reason is counter-intuitive — read
  the mutation table in
  `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-08-fulltext-import-without-httpx-design.md`
  before removing either.** They overlap: once httpx moved into
  `FullTextService.__init__`, restoring the eager re-export gated nothing and
  **no test failed**. The deferral's own contribution is that
  `import bmlib.fulltext` never loads `service`, so no future top-level import
  there can gate the parser, models or segmenter again;
  `test_importing_the_package_does_not_load_the_service` isolates it, written
  *because* mutation testing found nothing else did.
- **`_http_get` had no test at all** until that review — all ~45 tests in the
  file patch it, so replacing its body with `raise AssertionError` left the
  suite green. `TestHttpGet` covers it now.
- **`fulltext = ["httpx>=0.25"]` is httpx only**; `pdf` stays separate (a
  ~20 MB wheel for anyone who only wants JATS).
  `test_the_extra_the_error_message_names_is_a_real_one` reads
  `Provides-Extra` from the installed metadata, so the message and
  `pyproject.toml` cannot drift apart.

## fulltext — the exhausted-chain report (#67, PR #69)

- **The warning belongs outside the `if abstract_only is not None:` branch,
  and that placement is the whole fix.** Inside it, the *more* complete
  failure was the quieter one. Mutation testing confirms it: putting the
  warning back inside the branch — the original bug — fails two tests.
- **Faults and absences are counted apart, and that is the discrimination
  the report exists to make.** `N attempts failed (ConnectError)` is a lost
  network; `N sources had nothing` is an ordinary paywalled paper; a
  `TypeError` among the faults is a bug. A single count could not say this.
- **The first cut still printed the reassuring line during a total outage,
  for two reasons worth remembering.** (1) Both resolvers reported an HTTP
  failure by *returning* `(None, None)` — which is also what an empty result
  set returns — so a 503 incremented nothing. A swallowed exception is not
  the only way a tier goes wrong; anything reporting failure in the same
  shape as absence has this bug. (2) `FullTextError` was raised alike for
  `Unpaywall HTTP 503` and `DOI not found in Unpaywall`. Hence
  `FullTextUnavailableError`, and hence `note_absence()`.
- **The counter says *attempts*, never tiers.** `_try_known_sources` records
  once per fetcher-supplied source, so it is not bounded by the chain's eight
  tiers — "9 tiers raised" was emittable from a run that attempted four.
- **`_download_and_cache_pdf`'s *download* half is deliberately not wired to
  the counter** — see #68 above. All three call sites return immediately
  after it, so a recorded failure could never be reported; threading it would
  be dead plumbing that reads as coverage. A comment at the handler says so,
  since the other eight swallowers were wired. Its *cache-write* half was
  split out into `_save_pdf_to_cache`: an unwritable directory is not a
  download failure, and folding the two left a PDF-only corpus with no cache
  warning at all.
- **`_resolve_pmc_id_via_idconv` takes `failures` as *optional*** because of
  its fourteen direct callers in the tests, which have no report to feed it.
  Not "because it swallows its own exceptions": Tier 0 swallows too and takes
  the parameter as required.
- **A successful retrieval emits no *exhaustion* warning** — pinned by two
  controls, one where nothing fails and one where an attempt fails and a
  later tier recovers. The narrow wording is deliberate: a success may still
  warn about an unwritable cache or an unextractable PDF.
- **A 404 is an absence from an *article* endpoint and a fault from a
  *search* endpoint.** Europe PMC answers "no such paper" with HTTP 200 and
  an empty list, so a 404 on the search path means the API moved; on an
  article path it means the paper is not there, which for a stored fetcher
  URL is ordinary staleness. Three of the four article fetchers called it a
  fault until review caught it.
- **`describe()`'s wording is pinned at its source**, not only through a tier
  chain. It is a documented interface — the manual tells operators to grep
  for it — and asserting it through `fetch_fulltext` left the singular branch
  untested and the counts matched by substring, where `"13 attempts failed"`
  satisfies `"3 attempts failed"`.

## fulltext — the cache is written atomically (#70, #71, PR #74)

Each of these looks like a line worth simplifying, and each re-opens the bug.
All are pinned by a named test in `test_fulltext_cache.py` /
`test_fulltext_service.py`, and all six mutations were run.

- **The `flush()` + `os.fsync()` before `os.replace` is not durability
  theatre.** Under delayed allocation a `write()` that will fail for want of
  space *returns success*, and the error surfaces only at flush time — so
  without it `os.replace` publishes a file whose blocks were never written,
  which is #70 again one layer down. Removing those two lines fails four
  tests, because the fault the tests inject is the real disk-full one.
- **The temp file's name carries a UUID.** A fixed `.tmp` suffix lets two
  processes caching the same article interleave into one temp file and
  manufacture exactly the corruption the function exists to prevent.
- **The mode is `0o644` filtered by the umask, not `tempfile.mkstemp`'s
  0600.** A cache directory shared between users otherwise breaks silently:
  the second user cannot read what the first cached, re-fetches everything,
  and replaces the file with one the first then cannot read. Pinned by
  comparing against an ordinary write in the same directory, so the assertion
  holds whatever the umask is.
- **`save_html`/`save_pdf` raise rather than swallowing.** Both
  `FullTextService` call sites already report a failed cache write (#67), and
  a caller told nothing would believe the article was cached.
- **#71's guard is `except Exception`, and narrowing it restores the bug.** A
  decode failure is only the shape #71 was reported in; a cached file the
  process cannot read raises `OSError` instead. Mutation testing found the
  first cut *survived* narrowing to `UnicodeDecodeError` — the extra test
  (`test_an_entry_that_fails_for_any_other_reason_falls_through_too`, which
  puts a directory where the file should be, so it raises for root too) exists
  because of that.
- **The unreadable file is not deleted.** A successful re-fetch overwrites it
  — pinned by a test — and a failed one leaves the evidence to inspect.
  Deleting a user's data on a read error is a larger action than the bug asks
  for.
- **That warning is per article, where the *write* warning is once per
  service.** An unwritable directory is a property of the directory; an
  unreadable file is a property of that one file, and naming it is what lets
  an operator delete it. It is also not counted on #67's exhaustion report:
  the cache is not a retrieval attempt, and the line already says more than
  that report's two buckets could.

## fulltext — the PDF converter (PR #60)

- **A password-protected PDF is rejected on `doc.needs_pass`, never on
  `doc.is_encrypted`.** An *owner* password restricts permissions without
  blocking reads, so such a file is encrypted and converts perfectly;
  widening the check to `is_encrypted` would reject it. Both guards carry an
  owner-password negative control for exactly that
  (`test_an_owner_password_alone_does_not_block_conversion` /
  `..._extraction`), so neither is a check that cannot fail.
- **`extract_blocks()` keeps its explicit check even though it already
  raised** — it raised only because `get_text()` failed of its own accord,
  and had that stopped, it would have returned `[]`, exactly what an
  image-only scan returns. The general lesson, and the reason #57 existed:
  `except` blocks written to keep one bad page from aborting the rest will
  also absorb a whole-file failure, and the result reports as a success.

## fulltext — PDF section segmenter (PR #55)

- **`TextBlock` is one PDF *line*, not a span, with font attributes from the
  dominant span** (most non-whitespace characters, ties to the first).
  PyMuPDF starts a new span at every font change, so upstream's span-level
  blocks shattered a mixed-font heading into fragments no anchored pattern
  could match. Pinned by `test_a_heading_split_across_spans_is_one_block` and
  `test_a_superscript_marker_does_not_restyle_the_line`.
- **Nothing is dropped for being empty or unclassified**, each with a named
  test: front matter is a 0.5-confidence section (if the real first heading
  was missed, it has swallowed the introduction); a heading with no body is
  reported with `content == ""`; and `SectionType.TITLE`,
  `SegmentedDocument.authors` and `Section.subsections` are reserved, not
  dead (the `outcome_switching_detected` precedent).
- **`extract_blocks()` raises where `convert()` returns a failed result** —
  a partial block list is indistinguishable from a sparse PDF, so degrading
  would be silent, where `converted_pages` says how partial a conversion was.
  Pinned by `test_a_corrupt_pdf_raises_rather_than_degrading`.
- **A negative vertical gap (column/page boundary) inserts no paragraph
  break** — a PDF gives no signal distinguishing a paragraph continuing
  across a page from one ending at it. The `height == 0` degenerate-bbox case
  is acknowledged in `_join_blocks` and left.
- **CONFLICTS owns the disclosure family, in both numbers** — listing the
  singular under FUNDING put the two numbers of one heading in different
  sections, decided by dict iteration order. A comment wards off re-adding it.
- **Two spec-level limits are documented in `docs/manual/fulltext.md` rather
  than fixed:** the 0.7 partial-match pass can fire on a bold figure caption
  ("Fig. 3 Study results" → RESULTS), and `min_heading_size` is an absolute
  floor (10.0) in an otherwise median-relative design, so it can silence the
  segmenter on a 9pt two-column layout. Callers check `Section.confidence`.

## citations (merged, PR #58)

**Argued in full in `docs/manual/citations.md` and
`docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-06-citations-port-design.md` — read them
before "correcting" anything here.** Upstream's *code* is the output spec,
not its docstrings, where the two disagree. Five upstream-faithful oddities
are kept rather than unified (per-style empty-title rendering, the ambiguous
bare inverted `authors` string, `"\n---"` with no leading blank line,
`"Smithn.d."`, `author_surname("Jan van der Berg") == "Berg"`), each pinned
by a test naming it. Two deliberate departures: `Citation` compares by all
fields, and marker ids stay `int` only. Five upstream defects were fixed,
the fifth from PR #58's review — a whitespace-only author entry crashed every
style with `IndexError`.

## publications — PubMed metadata graft (PR #59)

**CLAUDE.md argues most of this port in full — read it there, and do not
re-derive any of it.** "Replace-per-source child rows" settles the `source`
column and scoped delete, `_stamp_source()`, the `ValueError` on an unnamed
row, the absent UNIQUE constraint, the empty guard and `_consolidate_rows()`;
"Markdown, measured against the markup" settles the mixed-content walker,
strip-once, edge whitespace outside the markers, `Label` **or**
`NlmCategory`, the measured escape set, and `<u>`. Each is pinned by a named
test on both backends, several verified by mutation. Only what it omits:

- **PubMed repeats a `<Grant>` block verbatim** — 31 of 575 entries across 200
  NIH-funded records — so `_parse_grants()` collapses exact repeats, keeping
  first-occurrence order. Two grants differing in any field are two grants.
- **`position` indexes `<AuthorList>`, not `Publication.authors`** — it counts
  the `<CollectiveName>` consortia that `authors` skips, so the two differ in
  length whenever one is present and `authors[a.position]` is the wrong way to
  resolve an affiliation's author (match on `author`). What position is *for*
  — first or senior author — is right either way. Accepted knock-on: a
  consortium stating an affiliation loses it, since recording it would put an
  `author` in the table that is absent from `authors`, breaking the one join
  the column exists for. Pinned by
  `test_position_indexes_the_xml_author_list_not_the_authors_field`.
- **`store_publication()` does not write `publication_id` back onto the
  `Grant` / `AuthorAffiliation` objects it is given**, unlike `pub`, which it
  mutates in place and documents as such (the `FullTextSource` precedent). The
  failure would be silent — the field reads `0`, a plausible id rather than an
  obvious sentinel. Pinned by `test_the_caller_s_objects_are_not_mutated`.
- **`is_retracted` and upstream's `_extract_date` were not ported.**
  `publication_types` already carries "Retracted Publication",
  `retractions.py` answers authoritatively, and upstream reads RefType
  `RetractionOf` (this article *is* the notice) as retracted. `_parse_pubdate`
  is strictly better than `_extract_date`, which defaults a missing month and
  day to `01` — inventing precision — and swallows every failure bare.
- **`~x~` / `^x^` are Pandoc extensions, knowingly.** A renderer without them
  shows the tildes literally; the alternative flattened `CO<sub>2</sub>` and
  `CO<sup>2</sup>` to the same ambiguous `CO2`. Documented in the manual.
- **Which elements get the formatting walker is decided by NLM's DTD.**
  `ArticleTitle`, `AbstractText` and `Affiliation` are declared `(%text;)*` —
  `#PCDATA | b | i | sup | sub | u` — so all three use
  `_text_with_formatting`. `Journal/Title`, `DescriptorName` and
  `PublicationType` are `(#PCDATA)`, genuine leaves, and keep plain `.text`.
  Do not widen or narrow this list by eye; check the DTD.

## publications — retractions

- **`bmlib.publications.retractions` has no downloader** (the Crossref
  endpoint 504s freely), **is not a fetcher and never will be without a
  protocol change** (a notice annotates a paper usually not in the caller's
  table — see the design doc's "Why this is not a fetcher"), **is not wired
  into `transparency/` or `quality/`** (both are scoring changes moving
  stored values), and **has no `is_paper_retracted()` wrapper** (keeping the
  pure rule separable from the I/O is what makes it testable).
- **Two values measured against the live export, not reasoned about**: the
  `%m/%d/%Y` / `%d/%m/%Y` ambiguity resolves US-first (confirmed by same-file
  dates whose day exceeds 12), and `_ABSENT_IDENTIFIER_VALUES` holds exactly
  `{"0", "unavailable"}` — a third sentinel needs its own measurement.

## quality — Cochrane assessor (merged, PR #54)

Full reasoning in `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-05-cochrane-assessor-design.md`
and `docs/manual/quality.md`; every claim below has a named test.

- **Nothing is fabricated to fill a gap:** `assess()` returns `None` on
  failure rather than nine defaulted "Unclear risk" domains;
  `collapse_risk_of_bias()` raises on an unrecognised `bias_type` rather than
  skipping it into a `BiasRisk` that looks complete; `unclear` outranks `low`
  in its worst-wins reduction; `_enrich_with_cochrane()` does not copy
  Cochrane's `evidence_level` onto the assessment's; `study_id` comes from the
  caller, never parsed from an author list.
- **`_ASSESSMENT_ATTEMPTS = 2`, not 1 or 3** — `chat_json()` already retries
  inside each attempt; two keeps the worst case at six model calls.
- **Oversized text is condensed in exactly two passes** — digest, then one
  nine-domain judgement, no per-chunk verdicts to merge (blinding needs the
  whole Methods in view) — and **`_condense()` checks `len(digest)` against
  the budget, not `ProcessingStatus`**: `TRUNCATED` names the recursion
  ceiling, not the size of what it produced (a 21,269-char digest was measured
  emerging from a 200-char budget). Carries a negative control,
  `test_the_guard_does_not_reject_a_digest_that_actually_fits`.
