# HANDOVER — bmlib development

_Last updated: 2026-08-11. **0.9.0 is released and on PyPI** — five `fulltext`
fixes (#64, #67, #70, #71, #75). Nothing stored moved, so nothing needs
re-syncing; it is a minor rather than a patch bump because three of the fixes
change a public API. Verified against the *published* wheel, not just the
source tree: it installs on jinja2 alone and all 69 modules import, one fresh
interpreter each. Since the release, `fix/68-72-79-pdf-download-reporting` has
closed #79, #68 and #72 (unreleased) — Tier 1d now takes the free PDFs Europe
PMC actually labels `"Open access"`, and a failed PDF download or a swallowed
bmlib bug is reported instead of hiding behind a tier that still works. Three
open issues: **#56**, **#73**, **#78**. 1893 tests + 58 skipped (1949 + 2
with a PostgreSQL DSN), ruff clean.
**Phase 3 of the bmlibrarian port is next, and each of its rows needs a design
conversation before any porting** — see "Next up"._

This file briefs the next session on what is done, what is still open, and
the conventions to keep. Update it whenever a session materially changes the
plan; delete sections that are finished and no longer instructive. Per-PR
implementation detail lives in git history, `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/plans/`
— do not re-narrate it here.

## Current state

- **Version 0.9.0.** Release history: 0.4.0 (2026-07-19) → 0.5.0 → 0.5.1 →
  0.6.0 (2026-07-30) → 0.7.0 (2026-08-04) → 0.8.0 (2026-08-08) → 0.9.0
  (2026-08-10). 0.3.0 was bumped in-tree but never released; its changes
  shipped inside 0.4.0. The version lives in **four** places —
  `pyproject.toml`, `bmlib/__init__.py`, the README version line,
  `CLAUDE.md`'s header — and all four agree.
- **What each release shipped is in `CHANGELOG.md`** — do not re-narrate it
  here. 0.6.0, 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 each moved stored values, none behind a flag,
  and they compound for anyone upgrading across them; 0.8.0's largest is the
  PubMed one, which changes the shape of every synced title and abstract.
  **0.9.0 moves nothing stored** — it is five fixes and some log lines. It is
  a minor bump because three of those fixes change a public API, not because
  anything stored moved; the two questions are independent and the version
  number answers the API one.
- **`~/src/bmlibrarian` still pins `bmlib[ollama]>=0.5.1,<0.6.0`**, so it has
  now missed four releases. Widening it is a downstream change, not a bmlib
  one.
- **1893 tests passing + 58 skipped** (`uv run pytest tests/ -q`); **1949 + 2
  with `BMLIB_TEST_POSTGRESQL_DSN` set**. 56 of the default skips are the
  PostgreSQL parameterisations of `tests/test_backends.py`; 1 is a
  PostgreSQL-only schema test; 1 is `test_pymupdf_requires_dependency`, which
  runs only when PyMuPDF is *absent*. **PyMuPDF is installed in the dev
  venv** (PR #55 did it so the extraction tests run locally).
- **Run the PostgreSQL half locally — it is two minutes and it finds real
  bugs.** Postgres.app ships the binaries. The socket directory must be a
  *short* path (the 103-byte limit bites, and a scratchpad path exceeds it;
  `createdb` then fails while `pg_ctl` reports success):
  ```bash
  PGBIN=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/16/bin
  mkdir -p /tmp/bmlpg/run
  $PGBIN/initdb -D /tmp/bmlpg/data -U postgres --auth=trust
  $PGBIN/pg_ctl -D /tmp/bmlpg/data \
      -o "-k /tmp/bmlpg/run -p 55432 -c listen_addresses=''" -l /tmp/bmlpg/pg.log start
  $PGBIN/createdb -h /tmp/bmlpg/run -p 55432 -U postgres bmlib_test
  export BMLIB_TEST_POSTGRESQL_DSN="host=/tmp/bmlpg/run port=55432 dbname=bmlib_test user=postgres"
  ```
- **Documentation was rewritten for 0.4.0 and has been kept current since.**
  Treat drift as a regression worth fixing, not expected staleness. The
  `(unreleased)` markers in `docs/manual/` and `ROADMAP.md` are promoted at
  release time; **four are outstanding** — the `fix/68-72-79-pdf-download-reporting`
  branch's `ROADMAP.md` rows for #79, #68, #72 and
  `scripts/sample_free_pdf_urls.py`, none yet promoted to a version number.
  Markers inside `docs/superpowers/plans/` are historical records — leave them
  alone.

## Next up

### Open GitHub issues

Three, all found by review rather than by a failing test.

**#73 — `install_defaults()` copies templates non-atomically**, found while
fixing #70 and deliberately not folded into it. A copy interrupted partway
leaves a truncated template that `if not dest.exists()` then skips forever, so
a prompt missing its last half renders and is sent to a model. Milder than #70
— one-time setup from a local file, degrading a prompt rather than fabricating
an article — and it carries a decision: `_atomic_write` is private to
`fulltext/cache.py`, so fixing this means either promoting it to a shared
internal module or accepting a second copy. Worth deciding once.

**#56 — `_extract_title()` trusts junk PDF metadata titles** ("Microsoft
Word - manuscript.docx" wins over the large-font first-page line), deferred
from PR #55's review. Note what it will cost to do *properly*: this repo
settles list-shaped questions by measuring a corpus, not by taste (the
industry-funder stems, the Markdown escape set, the DataBankName allow-list
are all precedents), so a reject-list for junk titles wants a sample of real
PDF metadata behind it rather than a guessed set of prefixes and suffixes.
The issue already asks for a regression test per rejected shape plus a
negative control. Every closed design stays in `docs/superpowers/specs/` as
the record of what was rejected and why.

**#78 — the release merge strategy is enforced by prose only**, found
reviewing PR #77. `HANDOVER.md` requires a release PR be merged with
`--merge` so the tag lands on `main`'s first-parent line, but the repo still
allows squash and rebase merges and no branch protection covers `main`, so
the requirement is prose only and GitHub's default merge button can silently
defeat it. Latent — 0.4.0 through 0.9.0 were all merged correctly — the fix
is one `gh api -X PATCH` disabling the other two strategies, or a protection
rule if squash is wanted for ordinary feature PRs.

### Worth doing, not yet an issue

- **Widen bmlibrarian's `<0.6.0` pin** so the mother project can consume
  0.6.0 through 0.9.0. Read the three intervening releases' non-comparable
  behaviour changes first — the transparency ones move stored scores, and
  0.8.0 moves every PubMed title and abstract. 0.9.0 adds nothing to that
  list, but it does carry three API changes, so the widened pin should clear
  `FullTextService.cache` being nullable.
- **Wire the segmenter and the rule-based extractors in.** Two halves of the
  same roadmap item: the segmenter could give `CochraneAssessor`
  Methods/Results boundaries and `TransparencyAnalyzer` the paper's own
  Funding/COI/Data-availability sections; `quality/extractors.py` is still
  called by no tier. Each needs its own design conversation.
- **Feed the stored grants to `transparency/`.** `TransparencyAnalyzer` runs
  its own `efetch` per paper to read `<GrantList>`, which `fetch_pubmed` has
  now already stored at sync time. Reading the table instead would save that
  request — but it is a scoring change that moves stored values, so it needs
  its own decision, not a quiet optimisation.

### bmlibrarian → bmlib porting (Phase 3 is next)

The "mother project" `~/src/bmlibrarian` holds functionality that belongs in
bmlib. The assessment and phased backlog live in
[`docs/plans/2026-07-17-bmlibrarian-porting-analysis.md`](docs/plans/2026-07-17-bmlibrarian-porting-analysis.md)
— **read that first.** It has a master priority table, a "do not port" list
with reasons, and open caveats (ClinicalTrials.gov legacy XML deprecation,
transparency/quality reconciliation, no GRADE engine exists, SSRF guard).

- **Phases 0, 1 and 2 are all done and shipped** — Phase 0 in 0.4.0, Phase 1
  in 0.7.0, Phase 2 across 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 (rows 10, 9, 8, 4 and 11 of the
  analysis doc's master table; PRs #51, #54, #55, #58, #59). Note those are
  rows in that table, not GitHub issues. CHANGELOG has what each shipped.
- **Phase 3 is next**: discovery (#12), `pubmed_search` (#13), MeSH (#21),
  ClinicalTrials.gov (#14 — **check the caveat first**, the legacy bulk XML
  the parser targets was deprecated in the 2024 API v2 migration). These are
  larger subsystems than anything in Phase 2; expect each to need its own
  design conversation rather than a straight port. Phase 4 (the prompt-driven
  agent family, paper_weight, review building-blocks) follows, and each of
  those must be reconciled against the existing `quality/` and
  `transparency/` rather than forked — see the analysis doc's caveats.

### The port recipe (repeat it)

1. **TDD, always.** Write behaviour tests first (the upstream code is the
   spec), watch them fail (a `ModuleNotFoundError` is the correct red for a
   new module), then port and watch them pass. Bug in a test you wrote? Fix
   the test, not correct code.
2. **Modernise to bmlib style:** AGPL header on every file,
   `from __future__ import annotations`, lowercase builtin generics,
   `datetime.UTC`.
3. **Sever app coupling:** replace `get_db_manager()`/`bmlibrarian.config`
   with injected connections/params; guard optional deps with
   `try/except ImportError` raising `pip install bmlib[extra]`; route LLM
   calls through `bmlib.llm` / `bmlib.agents.BaseAgent`, never raw `ollama`.
4. **Export** the public names from the package `__init__.py` `__all__` —
   and if the new module needs an extra, resolve it through a PEP 562
   `__getattr__` rather than re-exporting it eagerly (issue #64: one eager
   re-export made ten modules unimportable on a core install).
5. **Verify:** tests + both ruff commands clean before done.
6. **Record** each port in `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.
7. **Reconcile, don't fork:** where a port overlaps existing bmlib, build on
   the existing module.
8. **Read the spec on both sides; do not decide by eye.** Row 11's reviews
   found this three times. Reading someone's XML, check their DTD:
   `<Affiliation>` looks like a leaf, is declared `(%text;)*`, and a bare
   `.text` read silently dropped rows. Declaring an output format, you owe
   that format's rules for *every* value, not only the ones carrying markup:
   having decided titles were Markdown, the fetcher neither escaped the
   prose it wrapped nor checked that `<u>` had a Markdown spelling that was
   not already `<b>`'s.

## Deliberate non-fixes — do not "fix" these

**Moved to [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md). Read it before
"correcting" anything that looks wrong in `db/`, `llm/`, `agents/`,
`context_processor/`, `citations/`, `quality/`, `transparency/`,
`publications/` or `fulltext/`.** Each entry there was investigated and closed
as correct, so reopening one wastes a session; the file also records where
each argument lives in full (CLAUDE.md, `docs/manual/`,
`docs/superpowers/specs/`). Add new entries there, not here — this file is for
what still needs doing.

## Conventions and gotchas for the next session

- Coding rules live in `CLAUDE.md` — pure functions with the DB-API
  connection as first argument, type hints and docstrings on everything
  public, AGPL-3 header on every source file, dataclass models with
  `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` where they persist, explicit SQL (no ORM),
  optional dependencies guarded with a helpful `ImportError`.
- `uv` only (never pip). Tests: `uv run pytest tests/ -v`.
- **Lint with the CI-pinned ruff, not the one in `.venv`** — CI pins
  **0.15.20** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), while `.venv` holds an older
  one that false-flags rules newer ruff removed:
  `uvx ruff@0.15.20 check . && uvx ruff@0.15.20 format --check .`
- Tests use in-memory SQLite (`connect_sqlite(":memory:")`) and mocked HTTP;
  no external services. `BMLIB_TEST_POSTGRESQL_DSN` must point at a database
  the tests may drop every table in (recipe under "Current state").
- New functionality needs unit tests; see CLAUDE.md's test-file mapping
  table.
- Session workflow lives in the `nextsession` skill
  (`.claude/skills/nextsession/`); the post-review fix-up workflow lives in
  the `fixall` skill (`.claude/skills/fixall/`).
- **Cutting a release** (0.4.0 through 0.9.0 were all cut this way): bump
  the version in the **four** places that carry it — `pyproject.toml`,
  `bmlib/__init__.py`, the README version line, `CLAUDE.md`'s header —
  promote the CHANGELOG's `[Unreleased]` body under a dated `## [X.Y.Z]`
  heading (leaving `## [Unreleased]` above it) with a short prose summary
  under it, promote any `(unreleased)` markers in `docs/manual/` and
  `ROADMAP.md`, then commit on a `release/X.Y.Z` branch and open a PR.
  **The number is a claim about the API, not about the data**: 0.9.0 was cut
  as 0.8.1 and renumbered in review, because three of its fixes changed a
  public API while nothing stored moved, and bmlib's downstream pins are
  written on the convention that a minor bump is the one that may break.
  After CI is green: merge with **`--merge`, not squash**, so the tag lands on
  main's first-parent line — nothing enforces this, see #78; tag the **merge
  commit** `vX.Y.Z` and push it; then create the GitHub release, which is
  **what publishes** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` rebuilds, refuses to go
  on unless the tag matches `bmlib.__version__`, runs `twine check --strict`,
  asserts `py.typed` survived packaging, and uploads via Trusted Publishing.
  **Hand the `pypi` environment gate over rather than approving it**, even
  when `gh api .../pending_deployments` says `current_user_can_approve: true`:
  a PyPI upload is irreversible and the version can never be reused. Nothing
  is lost by waiting — the run stays approvable indefinitely. Afterwards
  verify against `https://pypi.org/simple/bmlib/`, not the JSON API, which
  serves a stale CDN cache; a failed `pip install` immediately after is
  propagation, not a bad upload. Rehearse the whole path any time with a
  `workflow_dispatch` run, which targets TestPyPI only.
- **Rehearse the release gates locally before opening the PR** — `uv build`,
  `twine check --strict` on both artifacts, and a clean-venv install asserting
  `py.typed` survived packaging. `release.yml` runs them only *after* the
  version is burned and the release is public, so a failure there is expensive
  and a failure locally is free. On any release touching an `__init__.py`,
  probe the built wheel **one fresh interpreter per module** as well: a single
  process leaves the half-initialised parent in `sys.modules` and its siblings
  then falsely read as importable, which is how #64 was first mis-scoped.
  0.9.0 was checked that way twice — 69 importable / 0 not, locally and again
  against the published wheel.
- **Do not upload by hand.** The publish job has no `skip-existing`, so a
  manual upload makes it fail on a duplicate — which is why v0.5.0's and
  v0.6.0's runs still sit unapproved. v0.7.0, v0.8.0 and v0.9.0 all went the
  whole way through the workflow.
