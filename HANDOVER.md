# HANDOVER — bmlib development

_Last updated: 2026-08-13. **0.9.1 is cut** — four `fulltext` issues (#79,
#68, #72, #56) plus five smaller fixes found reviewing them, merged to `main`
as PRs #80, #82 and #83. Tier 1d now takes the free PDFs Europe PMC actually
labels `"Open access"` (it had been discarding ~95% of them); a failed PDF
download and a swallowed bmlib defect are reported instead of hiding behind a
tier that still works; and a PDF's metadata title is believed only where page
1 prints it, measured over 235 real PDFs rather than guessed. **#79 moves what
downstream stores** — many more articles now come back with extracted text
instead of a bare link — and it is the only entry in the release that does.
It is a patch bump because nothing here breaks a public API: the one addition,
`ConversionResult.title`, is additive and declared last. Three open issues:
**#73**, **#78**, **#81**. On `main`: 2048 tests + 58 skipped (2104 + 2 with a
PostgreSQL DSN), ruff 0.15.20 clean.
**Phase 3 of the bmlibrarian port is next, and each of its rows needs a design
conversation before any porting** — see "Next up"._

This file briefs the next session on what is done, what is still open, and
the conventions to keep. Update it whenever a session materially changes the
plan; delete sections that are finished and no longer instructive. Per-PR
implementation detail lives in git history, `CHANGELOG.md` and `docs/plans/`
— do not re-narrate it here.

## Current state

- **Version 0.9.1.** Release history: 0.4.0 (2026-07-19) → 0.5.0 → 0.5.1 →
  0.6.0 (2026-07-30) → 0.7.0 (2026-08-04) → 0.8.0 (2026-08-08) → 0.9.0
  (2026-08-10) → 0.9.1 (2026-08-13). 0.3.0 was bumped in-tree but never
  released; its changes shipped inside 0.4.0. The version lives in **four**
  places — `pyproject.toml`, `bmlib/__init__.py`, the README version line,
  `CLAUDE.md`'s header — and all four agree.
- **What each release shipped is in `CHANGELOG.md`** — do not re-narrate it
  here. 0.6.0, 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 each moved stored values, none behind a flag,
  and they compound for anyone upgrading across them; 0.8.0's largest is the
  PubMed one, which changes the shape of every synced title and abstract.
  **0.9.0 moves nothing stored.** **0.9.1 moves one thing**: #79 makes Tier 1d
  take the free PDFs it had been discarding, so many more articles come back
  with `pdf_url` / `file_path` / extracted text instead of a bare link and a
  corpus's stored full text is not comparable across the upgrade — outbound
  traffic to Europe PMC rises with it. Nothing else in 0.9.1 changes a stored
  value. Note the two questions are independent: 0.9.0 was a *minor* bump
  moving nothing stored (three fixes changed a public API), and 0.9.1 is a
  *patch* bump that does move something stored (nothing breaks an API — its
  one addition, `ConversionResult.title`, is additive and declared last). The
  version number answers the API question, never the data one, so a downstream
  reading only the number must still read this list.
- **`~/src/bmlibrarian` still pins `bmlib[ollama]>=0.5.1,<0.6.0`**, so it has
  now missed five releases. Widening it is a downstream change, not a bmlib
  one.
- **Tests on `main`: 2048 passing + 58 skipped** (`uv run pytest tests/ -q`);
  **2104 + 2 with `BMLIB_TEST_POSTGRESQL_DSN` set**. 56 of the default skips
  are the PostgreSQL parameterisations of `tests/test_backends.py`; 1 is a
  PostgreSQL-only schema test; 1 is `test_pymupdf_requires_dependency`, which
  runs only when PyMuPDF is *absent*. **PyMuPDF is installed in the dev
  venv** (PR #55 did it so the extraction tests run locally).
- **Run the PostgreSQL half locally — it is two minutes and it finds real
  bugs.** Postgres.app ships the binaries. The socket directory must be a
  *short* path (the 103-byte limit bites, and a scratchpad path exceeds it;
  `createdb` then fails while `pg_ctl` reports success):
  ```bash
  PGBIN=/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/16/bin
  mkdir -p /tmp/bmlpg/run
  $PGBIN/initdb -D /tmp/bmlpg/data -U postgres --auth=trust
  $PGBIN/pg_ctl -D /tmp/bmlpg/data \
      -o "-k /tmp/bmlpg/run -p 55432 -c listen_addresses=''" -l /tmp/bmlpg/pg.log start
  $PGBIN/createdb -h /tmp/bmlpg/run -p 55432 -U postgres bmlib_test
  export BMLIB_TEST_POSTGRESQL_DSN="host=/tmp/bmlpg/run port=55432 dbname=bmlib_test user=postgres"
  ```
- **Documentation was rewritten for 0.4.0 and has been kept current since.**
  Treat drift as a regression worth fixing, not expected staleness. The
  `(unreleased)` markers in `docs/manual/` and `ROADMAP.md` are promoted at
  release time; **none is outstanding** — 0.9.1 promoted all eleven (seven
  `ROADMAP.md` rows, four `docs/manual/fulltext.md` spots, the last of which
  is a section heading whose in-page anchor had to move with it). Markers
  inside `docs/superpowers/plans/` are historical records — leave them alone.
- **`main` is protected by the `protect_main` ruleset** (added 2026-08-13):
  no deletion, no non-fast-forward push, and CodeQL code scanning plus code
  quality required to merge. CodeQL comes from GitHub's *default setup*, so
  there is no workflow file in the repo — and its generated workflow ignores a
  pull request's `reopened` action, so a PR that predates the setup needs a
  fresh commit rather than a close/reopen before its first analysis exists.
  The ruleset does **not** constrain the merge strategy; see #78.

## Next up

### Open GitHub issues

Three, all found by review rather than by a failing test. (**#56, #68, #72 and
#79 are closed** and shipped in 0.9.1.)

**#73 — `install_defaults()` copies templates non-atomically**, found while
fixing #70 and deliberately not folded into it. A copy interrupted partway
leaves a truncated template that `if not dest.exists()` then skips forever, so
a prompt missing its last half renders and is sent to a model. Milder than #70
— one-time setup from a local file, degrading a prompt rather than fabricating
an article — and it carries a decision: `_atomic_write` is private to
`fulltext/cache.py`, so fixing this means either promoting it to a shared
internal module or accepting a second copy. Worth deciding once.

**#78 — the release merge strategy is enforced by prose only**, found
reviewing PR #77. `HANDOVER.md` requires a release PR be merged with
`--merge` so the tag lands on `main`'s first-parent line, but the repo still
allows squash and rebase merges, so the requirement is prose only and
GitHub's default merge button can silently defeat it. **The `protect_main`
ruleset added on 2026-08-13 does not close this** — it covers deletion,
non-fast-forward pushes and code scanning, and is silent on merge strategy,
so do not read "main is protected now" as "#78 is handled". Latent — 0.4.0
through 0.9.1 were all merged correctly — the fix is one `gh api -X PATCH`
disabling the other two strategies, or extending the ruleset if squash is
wanted for ordinary feature PRs.

**#81 — CI runs ruff only, so `py.typed` claims a guarantee nothing checks**,
split out of the review of PR #80. That review found three correctness
properties in one file being carried by comments where a type could carry
them; two became `Literal`s in that branch, but the enforcement is at the
desk and not at the gate, and a downstream's mypy run is currently the first
thing in the world to check bmlib's types. `uv run mypy bmlib/` reports 24
errors in 15 files, 11 of them one recurring `**dict[str, object]` splat and
8 of them optional-extra imports, so this is one design call plus a handful
of one-offs rather than a long slog. Deliberately not done in #80: it touches
`llm/`, `agents/` and `publications/`, which that branch goes nowhere near.

### Worth doing, not yet an issue

- **Widen bmlibrarian's `<0.6.0` pin** so the mother project can consume
  0.6.0 through 0.9.1. Read the intervening releases' non-comparable
  behaviour changes first — the transparency ones move stored scores, 0.8.0
  moves every PubMed title and abstract, and **0.9.1 moves stored full text**
  (#79: Tier 1d now downloads the free PDFs it used to skip). 0.9.0 adds
  nothing to that list, but it carries three API changes, so the widened pin
  should clear `FullTextService.cache` being nullable.
- **Wire the segmenter and the rule-based extractors in.** Two halves of the
  same roadmap item: the segmenter could give `CochraneAssessor`
  Methods/Results boundaries and `TransparencyAnalyzer` the paper's own
  Funding/COI/Data-availability sections; `quality/extractors.py` is still
  called by no tier. Each needs its own design conversation.
- **Feed the stored grants to `transparency/`.** `TransparencyAnalyzer` runs
  its own `efetch` per paper to read `<GrantList>`, which `fetch_pubmed` has
  now already stored at sync time. Reading the table instead would save that
  request — but it is a scoring change that moves stored values, so it needs
  its own decision, not a quiet optimisation.

### bmlibrarian → bmlib porting (Phase 3 is next)

The "mother project" `~/src/bmlibrarian` holds functionality that belongs in
bmlib. The assessment and phased backlog live in
[`docs/plans/2026-07-17-bmlibrarian-porting-analysis.md`](docs/plans/2026-07-17-bmlibrarian-porting-analysis.md)
— **read that first.** It has a master priority table, a "do not port" list
with reasons, and open caveats (ClinicalTrials.gov legacy XML deprecation,
transparency/quality reconciliation, no GRADE engine exists, SSRF guard).

- **Phases 0, 1 and 2 are all done and shipped** — Phase 0 in 0.4.0, Phase 1
  in 0.7.0, Phase 2 across 0.7.0 and 0.8.0 (rows 10, 9, 8, 4 and 11 of the
  analysis doc's master table; PRs #51, #54, #55, #58, #59). Note those are
  rows in that table, not GitHub issues. CHANGELOG has what each shipped.
- **Phase 3 is next**: discovery (#12), `pubmed_search` (#13), MeSH (#21),
  ClinicalTrials.gov (#14 — **check the caveat first**, the legacy bulk XML
  the parser targets was deprecated in the 2024 API v2 migration). These are
  larger subsystems than anything in Phase 2; expect each to need its own
  design conversation rather than a straight port. Phase 4 (the prompt-driven
  agent family, paper_weight, review building-blocks) follows, and each of
  those must be reconciled against the existing `quality/` and
  `transparency/` rather than forked — see the analysis doc's caveats.

### The port recipe (repeat it)

1. **TDD, always.** Write behaviour tests first (the upstream code is the
   spec), watch them fail (a `ModuleNotFoundError` is the correct red for a
   new module), then port and watch them pass. Bug in a test you wrote? Fix
   the test, not correct code.
2. **Modernise to bmlib style:** AGPL header on every file,
   `from __future__ import annotations`, lowercase builtin generics,
   `datetime.UTC`.
3. **Sever app coupling:** replace `get_db_manager()`/`bmlibrarian.config`
   with injected connections/params; guard optional deps with
   `try/except ImportError` raising `pip install bmlib[extra]`; route LLM
   calls through `bmlib.llm` / `bmlib.agents.BaseAgent`, never raw `ollama`.
4. **Export** the public names from the package `__init__.py` `__all__` —
   and if the new module needs an extra, resolve it through a PEP 562
   `__getattr__` rather than re-exporting it eagerly (issue #64: one eager
   re-export made ten modules unimportable on a core install).
5. **Verify:** tests + both ruff commands clean before done.
6. **Record** each port in `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased]`.
7. **Reconcile, don't fork:** where a port overlaps existing bmlib, build on
   the existing module.
8. **Read the spec on both sides; do not decide by eye.** Row 11's reviews
   found this three times. Reading someone's XML, check their DTD:
   `<Affiliation>` looks like a leaf, is declared `(%text;)*`, and a bare
   `.text` read silently dropped rows. Declaring an output format, you owe
   that format's rules for *every* value, not only the ones carrying markup:
   having decided titles were Markdown, the fetcher neither escaped the
   prose it wrapped nor checked that `<u>` had a Markdown spelling that was
   not already `<b>`'s.

## Deliberate non-fixes — do not "fix" these

**Moved to [`docs/DECISIONS.md`](docs/DECISIONS.md). Read it before
"correcting" anything that looks wrong in `db/`, `llm/`, `agents/`,
`context_processor/`, `citations/`, `quality/`, `transparency/`,
`publications/` or `fulltext/`.** Each entry there was investigated and closed
as correct, so reopening one wastes a session; the file also records where
each argument lives in full (CLAUDE.md, `docs/manual/`,
`docs/superpowers/specs/`). Add new entries there, not here — this file is for
what still needs doing.

## Conventions and gotchas for the next session

- Coding rules live in `CLAUDE.md` — pure functions with the DB-API
  connection as first argument, type hints and docstrings on everything
  public, AGPL-3 header on every source file, dataclass models with
  `to_dict()`/`from_dict()` where they persist, explicit SQL (no ORM),
  optional dependencies guarded with a helpful `ImportError`.
- `uv` only (never pip). Tests: `uv run pytest tests/ -v`.
- **Lint with the CI-pinned ruff, not the one in `.venv`** — CI pins
  **0.15.20** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), while `.venv` holds an older
  one that false-flags rules newer ruff removed:
  `uvx ruff@0.15.20 check . && uvx ruff@0.15.20 format --check .`
- Tests use in-memory SQLite (`connect_sqlite(":memory:")`) and mocked HTTP;
  no external services. `BMLIB_TEST_POSTGRESQL_DSN` must point at a database
  the tests may drop every table in (recipe under "Current state").
- New functionality needs unit tests; see CLAUDE.md's test-file mapping
  table.
- Session workflow lives in the `nextsession` skill
  (`.claude/skills/nextsession/`); the post-review fix-up workflow lives in
  the `fixall` skill (`.claude/skills/fixall/`).
- **Cutting a release** (0.4.0 through 0.9.1 were all cut this way): bump
  the version in the **four** places that carry it — `pyproject.toml`,
  `bmlib/__init__.py`, the README version line, `CLAUDE.md`'s header —
  promote the CHANGELOG's `[Unreleased]` body under a dated `## [X.Y.Z]`
  heading (leaving `## [Unreleased]` above it) with a short prose summary
  under it, promote any `(unreleased)` markers in `docs/manual/` and
  `ROADMAP.md`, then commit on a `release/X.Y.Z` branch and open a PR.
  **The number is a claim about the API, not about the data**: 0.9.0 was cut
  as 0.8.1 and renumbered in review, because three of its fixes changed a
  public API while nothing stored moved, and bmlib's downstream pins are
  written on the convention that a minor bump is the one that may break.
  0.9.1 is the other side of that same convention: #79 moves stored full text
  while nothing breaks an API, so it is a patch.
  After CI **and CodeQL** are green — the `protect_main` ruleset requires the
  scan, and a release PR is subject to it like any other: merge with
  **`--merge`, not squash**, so the tag lands on
  main's first-parent line — nothing enforces this, see #78; tag the **merge
  commit** `vX.Y.Z` and push it; then create the GitHub release, which is
  **what publishes** — `.github/workflows/release.yml` rebuilds, refuses to go
  on unless the tag matches `bmlib.__version__`, runs `twine check --strict`,
  asserts `py.typed` survived packaging, and uploads via Trusted Publishing.
  **Hand the `pypi` environment gate over rather than approving it**, even
  when `gh api .../pending_deployments` says `current_user_can_approve: true`:
  a PyPI upload is irreversible and the version can never be reused. Nothing
  is lost by waiting — the run stays approvable indefinitely. Afterwards
  verify against `https://pypi.org/simple/bmlib/`, not the JSON API, which
  serves a stale CDN cache; a failed `pip install` immediately after is
  propagation, not a bad upload. Rehearse the whole path any time with a
  `workflow_dispatch` run, which targets TestPyPI only.
- **Rehearse the release gates locally before opening the PR** — `uv build`,
  `twine check --strict` on both artifacts, and a clean-venv install asserting
  `py.typed` survived packaging. `release.yml` runs them only *after* the
  version is burned and the release is public, so a failure there is expensive
  and a failure locally is free. On any release touching an `__init__.py`,
  probe the built wheel **one fresh interpreter per module** as well: a single
  process leaves the half-initialised parent in `sys.modules` and its siblings
  then falsely read as importable, which is how #64 was first mis-scoped.
  0.9.0 was checked that way twice — 69 importable / 0 not, locally and again
  against the published wheel.
- **Do not upload by hand.** The publish job has no `skip-existing`, so a
  manual upload makes it fail on a duplicate — which is why v0.5.0's and
  v0.6.0's runs still sit unapproved. v0.7.0, v0.8.0 and v0.9.0 all went the
  whole way through the workflow.
