# Changelog

All notable changes to bmlib are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); bmlib follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`bmlib.publications` works on PostgreSQL.** `schema.py`, `storage.py` and
  `sync.py` were SQLite-only (`?` placeholders, `cur.lastrowid`,
  `UPDATE OR IGNORE`, `AUTOINCREMENT`) even though `bmlib.db` has supported
  both backends all along. Every statement is now written for both, and
  `ensure_schema()` picks the matching DDL. The behaviour is pinned by
  `tests/test_backends.py`, which runs each test against both backends.
- `bmlib.db.is_sqlite()`, `placeholder()` and `placeholders()` — the backend
  detection every dual-dialect module needs, promoted out of the private
  helpers in `db/migrations.py`.
- `publications.pmcid` — a column, a `Publication` field, and the conversion
  in `sync._record_to_publication()`. `FetchedRecord.pmc_id` was being dropped
  on store, so full-text retrieval could not use the PMC id a fetcher had
  already found. `ensure_schema()` adds the column to databases created by an
  earlier bmlib. The field is declared **last** on the dataclass, not beside
  `pmid` where it reads best: `Publication` is constructed positionally by
  downstream projects, so any other placement would shift every following
  argument and land a caller's `abstract` in `pmcid` with no error anywhere.
  Pinned by `test_positional_construction_is_stable_across_versions`.
- `bmlib.db.transaction_depth()` / `owns_commit()` — how many `transaction()`
  blocks the calling thread has open on a connection.
- Opt-in PostgreSQL test coverage: set `BMLIB_TEST_POSTGRESQL_DSN` to run the
  two-backend suite against a live server. Unset, those parameterisations skip
  and the suite is unchanged. CI runs it against a `postgres:16` service on
  every matrix entry, with `BMLIB_REQUIRE_POSTGRESQL=1` so a missing or broken
  DSN fails the build instead of skipping behind a green check.
- **`FullTextService` extracts a retrieved PDF's text into
  `FullTextResult.html`**, so a PDF-only article can be read inline. Needs the
  `bmlib[pdf]` extra and a cached PDF (that is, an `identifier`); opt out with
  `FullTextService(convert_pdfs=False)`. `pdf_url` and `file_path` stay
  populated, since extraction recovers prose but not figures, tables or
  layout. This closes the ROADMAP item that had the converter standalone.
- `fulltext.render_html()` — renders extracted PDF text as HTML, stripping
  repeated page furniture (running heads, footers, publisher watermarks) by a
  frequency rule that needs no per-publisher knowledge, and reflowing
  hard-wrapped lines back into paragraphs.
- `FullTextResult.content_kind` — says whether `html` holds a real article
  (`"fulltext"`), only an abstract (`"abstract"`), or prose extracted from a
  PDF (`"extracted"`). Code that scores or summarises an article should branch
  on this rather than on `html` being set.
- `JATSArticle.has_body` — whether `<body>` carried actual prose. It counts
  body paragraphs rather than `body_sections`, because back-matter sections
  land in the latter and a "Data Availability" section was otherwise passing
  for an article body.
- `JATSParser.parse_with_html()` — parses once and returns both the article
  and its HTML, instead of the two SAX passes `parse()` + `to_html()` cost.
- `ConversionResult.page_texts` — the text of each page that yielded any.
  Page boundaries are what let `render_html()` spot repeated furniture.

### Fixed

- **A body-less JATS document was mistaken for full text.** medRxiv's
  `jatsxml` URL serves, for some preprints, a document made of `<front>` and
  `<back>` alone. It returns HTTP 200 and parses cleanly, so the retrieval
  chain — which sorts `xml` ahead of `pdf` — treated it as a successful
  retrieval, never tried the PDF holding the actual article, and cached the
  abstract-only rendering permanently. Body presence varies per paper rather
  than per publisher, so this is fixed generically: such a document is now
  detected, never cached, and held back as a last resort while the chain keeps
  looking. If nothing better turns up it is returned with any resolved link
  attached, so the reader gets the abstract *and* somewhere to go.
- **Text extracted from a PDF was produced once and then lost.** Only the PDF
  bytes were cached, so a second `fetch_fulltext()` for the same identifier
  returned a bare `file_path` and the inline article text silently
  disappeared. A cached PDF hit now re-derives it.
- **A missing abstract killed the whole scoring batch.** A record with no
  abstract arrives as `None` from a nullable column, and both LLM tiers sliced
  it unguarded, so a `TypeError` escaped the assessment and took every later
  paper down with it. Both tiers now tolerate a `None` title or abstract. With
  *both* missing they return `unclassified()` without calling the model, since
  an empty prompt yields not an empty answer but an invented one that nothing
  downstream can tell from a real assessment.
- **The Tier 2 classifier's token budget could not be raised.** `classify()`
  repeated `temperature` and `max_tokens` at the call site, silently
  overriding the constructor. The classification JSON is ~50 tokens, but small
  local models preface it with commentary despite being asked for JSON alone,
  and the 256-token ceiling truncated the preamble and lost the JSON with it —
  affected papers fell back to `UNCLASSIFIED` with only a warning. The
  overrides are gone and the budget is now 1024, matching the assessor. Both
  agents carry their tuned sampling as constructor defaults, so it holds
  however they are built rather than only via `QualityManager`.
- **A PDF that yielded no text failed silently.** `PyMuPDFConverter.convert()`
  reports failure in its result rather than raising, so a corrupt PDF, an
  image-only scan, or a partial extraction all passed unlogged. Each is now
  reported at WARNING, and a partial extraction is flagged rather than
  attached as if it were the whole article.
- **`render_html()` collapsed a document into a single paragraph** when fewer
  than a tenth of its lines ran full width — a reference list, a table, a
  two-column extraction. The wrap-width estimate landed on a stub line, so no
  line ever counted as short enough to end a paragraph.
- **`fetch_scalar()` always returned `None` on PostgreSQL.** psycopg2's
  `RealDictRow` is keyed by column name, so `row[0]` raised `KeyError` and was
  swallowed by the fallback. It now reads the first value on dict-like rows.
- **`transaction()` now nests on PostgreSQL**, via savepoints, as it already
  did on SQLite. Previously an inner block committed connection-wide, so a
  batch's partial writes could not be rolled back — `publications.sync()`'s
  one-commit-per-day batching silently degraded to one commit per record.
  Nesting is detected from bmlib's own open-block count, *not* psycopg2's
  transaction status: psycopg2 opens a transaction on the first statement of
  any kind, so a bare `SELECT` would have made every following block look
  nested and stop committing. Un-nested blocks commit exactly as before.
  The count is kept per *(thread, connection)*: nesting describes one call
  stack, and counting by connection alone let a block open on one thread make
  an unrelated outermost block on another thread look nested — that block
  opened a savepoint, never committed, and its write was lost silently.
- `create_tables()` no longer commits mid-migration on PostgreSQL, so a
  migration that fails part-way rolls back whole. It already behaved this way
  on SQLite.
- `ensure_schema()` looks for existing columns in `current_schema()` only.
  `information_schema.columns` spans every schema the connected user can see,
  so on a database shared with another consumer the check could answer about
  *their* `publications` table — reporting `pmcid` present, skipping the
  `ALTER`, and failing the next write on the missing column.

### Compatibility

No public signature changed and nothing was removed. SQLite behaviour is
byte-for-byte unchanged — the full pre-existing suite passes untouched. On
PostgreSQL the changes above are strictly fixes to paths that were broken or
absent. Databases created by an earlier bmlib pick up the new `pmcid` column
on the next `ensure_schema()` call, which `sync()` makes for you.

Two details worth knowing when upgrading:

- **`ensure_schema()` is required after upgrading, not optional.** Reads
  tolerate a database that has not been through it — `storage` treats a
  post-release column as absent rather than raising — but writes name every
  column and will fail on one the database lacks. `sync()` calls it for you;
  code that goes straight to `store_publication()` must call it itself.
- `Publication` gained a field. Positional construction and `from_dict()` on a
  dict serialised by an older bmlib both behave exactly as before.

## [0.5.1] — 2026-07-21

All changes are confined to `bmlib/llm/providers/ollama.py`. No public
signature changed incompatibly; `list_models()` gained an optional keyword.

### Changed

- **`OllamaProvider.list_models()` now costs one HTTP request** regardless of
  how many models are installed, instead of one `/api/show` per model. On a
  server with 139 models the call went from minutes to 64 ms. It reads
  `/api/tags` as raw JSON rather than through the `ollama` SDK, whose Pydantic
  model silently drops the per-model `capabilities` array and
  `details.context_length`.
- `list_models()` results are cached for `CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` (60); pass the new
  `force_refresh=True` to bypass the cache. The cache is cleared only on a
  successful fetch, so a refused connection no longer discards accumulated
  results.
- Models whose `/api/tags` entry omits `context_length` return metadata whose
  `context_window` — and `capabilities.max_context_window` — resolves via a
  memoised `show()` call on first read, not at list time. `__repr__` renders
  `<unresolved>` rather than fetching, so logging a model list stays free.
  These objects degrade to plain `ModelMetadata` / `ProviderCapabilities` when
  copied, pickled, or passed through `dataclasses.replace()`. This is the only
  place in bmlib where attribute access performs I/O.

### Fixed

- **Capability flags from `list_models()` were always `False`.**
  `supports_function_calling` and `supports_vision` are now derived from the
  `/api/tags` capabilities array. They are a **lower bound**: `/api/show`,
  reached via `get_model_metadata()`, reports a superset for these two flags
  (across 139 local models, tags reported 77 tool-capable against show's 102,
  and 32 vision-capable against 44). Filter by capability with
  `get_model_metadata()` when completeness matters — but note it is
  authoritative only when its `show()` call succeeds; for a cloud model on a
  server with cloud disabled, `show()` returns 403 and the fallback is
  *weaker* than the listing.
- **Context windows resolved to the 8192 fallback for every model.**
  `_extract_context_window` looked up `model_info`, which `ShowResponse`
  declares as `modelinfo` with `model_info` only as an alias, so on a real SDK
  response the lookup returned `None`. Real windows (131072, 128000, …) now
  resolve. The string-valued `parameters` fallback was dead for the same
  reason and now works.
- `get_model_metadata()` hardcoded its capability flags to `False`, so it
  contradicted `list_models()` for the same model. It now derives them from
  `ShowResponse.capabilities`.
- GGUF emits both `<arch>.context_length` and
  `<arch>.rope.scaling.original_context_length` — 9 of 139 models carry both,
  differing by up to two orders of magnitude. The exact key now wins outright
  instead of the first loose "context" match, removing a dependence on key
  emission order.

### Security

- `OLLAMA_API_KEY` is no longer leaked across a redirect. `urllib` re-sends
  every header to any host on redirect, so a gateway answering `/api/tags`
  with a 302 elsewhere received the bearer token in full. The raw fetch now
  builds an opener that strips `Authorization` when the target origin differs,
  matching the SDK path; same-origin redirects keep it.
- `OLLAMA_HOST` is restricted to HTTP(S). `urlopen` honours whatever scheme it
  is given, so `OLLAMA_HOST=file://…` read a local path straight into
  `json.loads`.
- Scheme-less `OLLAMA_HOST` values work again. `urlsplit` reads the
  conventional `localhost:11434` as scheme `localhost`; a `<word>:<digits>`
  form is now treated as host:port.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-20

### Added

- **Batch embedding.** `LLMClient.embed_batch(texts, model=..., max_batch_size=None)`
  embeds many texts per provider round-trip instead of one request per text,
  returning a new `BatchEmbeddingResponse` (`embeddings` — one vector per input
  in input order, `model`, `dimensions`, `input_tokens` summed across requests).
  Measured on 32 chunks against a local Ollama server: 0.59 s batched vs 4.48 s
  looped (7.6×). `BaseProvider.embed_batch()` is a concrete default raising
  `NotImplementedError`, mirroring `embed()`, so third-party providers are
  unaffected; only Ollama overrides it. Batching is bounded — texts are sent in
  groups of at most `max_batch_size` (Ollama default:
  `DEFAULT_EMBED_BATCH_SIZE = 256`) so a large corpus does not become one
  enormous request; pass `max_batch_size=len(texts)` to force a single
  round-trip. Not atomic: if a later group fails, vectors already computed for
  earlier groups are discarded with the exception. A vector-count mismatch
  raises `ValueError`; request failure raises `ConnectionError` as before.
- Ollama `embed()` / `embed_batch()` now forward `**kwargs` verbatim to the
  ollama SDK (`truncate`, `options`, `keep_alive`); previously they were
  accepted and silently discarded, so `truncate=False` could not be set.
- **Thinking/reasoning support across providers.** `LLMResponse` gained an
  optional `thinking` field (appended after `tool_calls`, so positional
  construction is unaffected) carrying the model's reasoning trace separated
  from `content`. The `think` kwarg on `LLMClient.chat()` is now interpreted
  by every built-in provider, not just Ollama: `bool` toggles thinking, a
  `"low"`/`"medium"`/`"high"` string sets effort, an `int` sets a token
  budget. Ollama forwards `think` natively and extracts `message.thinking`;
  Anthropic enables extended thinking (`budget_tokens` clamped to
  `[1024, max_tokens - 1]`, sampling params omitted as the API requires) and
  extracts `thinking` content blocks; OpenAI-compatible providers send
  `reasoning_effort` for effort strings on reasoning models and extract
  `reasoning_content` / `reasoning` response fields, with an opt-in
  `<think>…</think>` content split for local servers that emit reasoning
  inline. Callers that never pass `think` see identical requests and
  untouched `content`. Known limitation: Anthropic thinking does not compose
  with multi-turn tool loops (thinking blocks are not round-tripped into
  follow-up requests) — see `docs/manual/llm.md` and ROADMAP.md.
- OpenAI-compatible providers accept an `extra_body` kwarg forwarded verbatim
  to the SDK, as the escape hatch for server-specific parameters (e.g. vLLM's
  `chat_template_kwargs`).

### Changed — breaking

- **Ollama embeddings moved to the `/api/embed` endpoint, changing vector
  scale.** `OllamaProvider.embed()` previously called the deprecated
  `/api/embeddings` endpoint, which returned **raw** vectors; it now delegates
  to `embed_batch()` and so uses `/api/embed`, which returns **L2-normalised**
  vectors. This keeps `embed(t)` and `embed_batch([t]).embeddings[0]` in
  permanent agreement — keeping the old endpoint for single embeds would have
  made them disagree in scale forever.

  Cosine similarity is scale-invariant and is unaffected. **Raw dot-product or
  Euclidean (L2) comparisons are affected**, and the failure is silent: mixing
  vectors stored before this change with vectors produced after it degrades
  retrieval quality with no exception and no warning. If your store uses a
  non-cosine distance metric, **re-embed the corpus**. Callers on cosine
  similarity need do nothing.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-19

### Changed — breaking

- **`bmlib.db.transaction()` no longer commits when joining an open
  transaction** (SQLite savepoint path). Previously, a `transaction(conn)`
  block entered while the connection already held uncommitted writes would
  call `conn.commit()` on success, committing the caller's pending writes
  along with its own. Now the block joins via a savepoint and the owner of
  the enclosing transaction commits. Code that relied on `transaction()` as
  a durability checkpoint after bare `execute()` writes must commit
  explicitly (or wrap the whole batch in an outer `transaction()`). The same
  applies to `run_migrations()` when called with a transaction already open.
  On PostgreSQL the old connection-wide commit behaviour is unchanged (no
  savepoint nesting is implemented there).
- **`bmlib.publications.sync()` buffers each day's records and stores them
  after the fetch.** The `on_record` callback now fires while the fetcher
  streams, *before* the record is stored — callbacks must not expect to read
  the record back from the database. Writes cost one commit per day instead
  of one per statement, and SQLite's write lock is no longer held across
  network I/O; in exchange, a day's records are held in memory during the
  fetch.
- `TransparencyAnalyzer._check_europepmc()` now returns a 6-tuple (adds
  `industry_coi`).

### Added

- transparency: industry conflict-of-interest detection in full-text
  COI/disclosure statements — negation-aware, scoped to the COI region, with
  a guard for non-industry contexts (university/government employment,
  editorial boards). ORs into `industry_funding_detected` at moderate
  confidence (#7).
- llm: embedding support in the LLM abstraction layer (`LLMClient.embed()`,
  `EmbeddingResponse`). Implemented by the Ollama provider; other providers
  inherit `BaseProvider.embed()`, which raises `NotImplementedError`.
- llm: tool calling — `LLMClient.chat()` accepts `tools` and `tool_choice`,
  with the new `LLMToolDefinition` and `LLMToolCall` data types,
  `LLMResponse.tool_calls`, and `LLMMessage.tool_calls` / `tool_call_id` for
  multi-turn tool conversations. Implemented for Anthropic, Ollama, and the
  OpenAI-compatible providers (OpenAI, DeepSeek, Mistral, Gemini). Passing
  `tools` to a provider that does not support them raises
  `NotImplementedError` before any network call. Ollama accepts but ignores
  `tool_choice` — its native API has no equivalent.
- llm: `supports_tools()` — public probe for the tool-calling allowlist, so
  callers can test support for a provider name or `"provider:model"` string
  without catching `NotImplementedError`.
- db: nested `transaction()` blocks on SQLite are now composable (savepoint
  join; the outer block owns the commit).
- llm: `bmlib.llm.json_repair` — repairs malformed LLM JSON (single quotes,
  trailing/missing commas, unescaped control chars, truncation, unquoted
  keys) via `repair_json()`, `safe_json_loads()`, `extract_and_repair_json()`.
  `BaseAgent.parse_json()` now uses it as a last-resort fallback. Ported from
  bmlibrarian.
- llm: `bmlib.llm.text_utils` — boundary-aware text chunking (`TextChunk`,
  `TextChunker`, `chunk_text`) that never drops text, plus map-reduce /
  rolling-summary long-document processing and document-text helpers. Ported
  and consolidated from bmlibrarian's two chunkers.
- quality: `bmlib.quality.cochrane_models` and `cochrane_formatter` —
  Cochrane-aligned nine-domain Risk-of-Bias models with judgement + rationale,
  the full study-characteristics table, and Markdown/HTML renderers. A strict
  superset of `BiasRisk`. Ported from bmlibrarian.
- quality: `bmlib.quality.extractors` and `scoring_models` — rule-based
  (LLM-free) study-type detection with exclusion-context guarding and
  sample-size scoring, producing `DimensionScore` audit trails. Ported from
  bmlibrarian's paper_weight.
- fulltext: `bmlib.fulltext.pdf_converter` — pluggable PDF→text conversion
  (`ConversionResult`, `PDFConverter`, `get_converter`, `list_converters`)
  with a PyMuPDF backend behind the new optional `bmlib[pdf]` extra. Ported
  from bmlibrarian.

### Fixed

- transparency: a JATS-tagged COI section now counts as `coi_disclosed=True`
  even when its wording contains no cue phrase — the tag is structural proof
  of a disclosure; the cue-phrase scan remains the fallback for untagged text
  (#13).
- llm: `list_models()` on the Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers now
  returns a copy of the cached model list; mutating a returned list no longer
  corrupts the cache for subsequent callers (#12).
- publications: batched database commits — one commit per stored publication
  and one per synced day instead of one per statement (#8).
- llm: `get_llm_client()` singleton creation is now thread-safe; the
  openai-compat `list_models()` caches a successful-but-empty response for
  the TTL instead of re-hitting the API every call; the Anthropic provider
  warns (once per model per instance) when an unknown model id falls back to
  estimated pricing (#9).
- fulltext: `FullTextCache` sanitizes identifiers internally, so a raw DOI or
  path-traversal string cannot write outside the cache directory;
  already-safe identifiers keep their exact filenames (#9).
- publications: the OpenAlex fetcher tolerates a `"meta": null` page instead
  of raising `AttributeError` (#9).
- agents: `chat_json()` now fails fast with the real cause when a response is
  truncated at the `max_tokens` ceiling, instead of reporting a generic
  "unparseable response". At `temperature == 0.0` it raises immediately —
  greedy sampling reproduces the identical truncation, so retrying only pays
  for it again; above 0.0 it retries, since a different sample may fit. A
  response that is complete JSON despite hitting the ceiling is returned
  rather than rejected. Truncation detection covers Anthropic's
  `stop_reason="max_tokens"` and the OpenAI-compatible `"length"`, and empty
  responses are now treated as retryable transport errors.
- fulltext: cache keys are now `{sanitized}_{sha1[:10]}`, so DOIs that
  differed only in characters the sanitizer collapsed (for example
  `10.1/a:b` and `10.1/a/b`) no longer share a cache file and serve each
  other's full text.
- fulltext: JATS parsing no longer drops abstract sections, mislabels table
  headers, or loses figure and table captions.
- fulltext: the final fallback result is labelled `source="pubmed"` rather
  than `"doi"` when it resolves to a PubMed URL.
- db: `create_tables()` no longer uses SQLite's `executescript()`, whose
  implicit `COMMIT` broke a surrounding `transaction()` block and left
  migrations non-atomic. Statements are split and executed individually.
- llm: provider names are normalised to lowercase in client routing, so
  `"Anthropic:claude-..."` resolves like `"anthropic:claude-..."`.
- llm: JSON extraction handles responses containing multiple objects and
  braces inside strings.
- llm: OpenAI reasoning models receive `max_completion_tokens` instead of the
  rejected `max_tokens`.
- llm: the Ollama provider no longer clobbers a legitimate zero token count
  when recording usage.
- quality: the Tier 1 metadata filter no longer misclassifies study designs
  from ambiguous PubMed publication types, and `QualityAssessment` records
  `is_randomized` from the new `DESIGN_TO_RANDOMIZED` mapping, so
  `QualityFilter.require_randomization` recognises a Tier 1/2 RCT instead of
  rejecting it.
- transparency: conflict-of-interest detection and the ClinicalTrials.gov
  posted-results check were both under-detecting — the latter requested
  `ResultsSection` but read `resultsSection`. The analyzer now returns an
  `UNKNOWN` risk level with score 0 when no external API was reachable,
  rather than letting an all-zero score read as HIGH risk.
- publications: full-text sources are no longer silently dropped during sync.
- publications: the bioRxiv fetcher records the correct PDF version, and the
  PubMed fetcher handles non-numeric month names in publication dates.
- publications: `fetch_pubmed()` now populates `publication_types` from
  `PublicationTypeList`. It never did, yet the free Tier 1 quality filter
  classifies study design from exactly that field — so every synced PubMed
  record skipped the free tier and fell through to the paid LLM classifier.
- publications: `register_source()` now registers the built-ins before
  writing its entry, so registering under a built-in name actually overrides
  it. Previously an override installed before the first lookup was silently
  reverted the moment lazy registration ran.
- publications: the three built-in fetchers annotated `on_record` as
  `Callable[[dict], None]` while passing a `FetchedRecord`; the annotations
  now match the behaviour, which is unchanged.
- transparency: `TransparencyAnalyzer` is now safe to share across threads,
  which is what makes `settings.max_concurrent_analyses` usable. Rate-limit
  state is mutex-guarded (the interval throttles a shared remote API, so it
  must apply across threads); reachability is held per-thread, since it
  describes a single analysis. Previously two concurrent `analyze()` calls
  contaminated each other: a thread whose APIs were all down inherited a
  concurrent thread's success and was scored 0 / HIGH instead of UNKNOWN,
  wrongly triggering a tier downgrade.
- transparency: `settings.enabled` is now honoured. `enabled=False`
  short-circuits `analyze()` before any HTTP — and before the `httpx` import,
  so a disabled analyzer does not require the optional extra. It was
  previously ignored and analysis ran regardless.
- transparency: `TransparencyResult.to_dict()` now round-trips
  `full_text_analyzed`. Dropping it made a persisted `coi_disclosed=False`
  uninterpretable, since that value only means "scanned and absent" when the
  full text really was read.
- transparency: removed the unreachable `resultsSection` fallback in
  `_check_trial_results()`. The request is narrowed to `fields=hasResults`,
  so no other key can come back; the fallback implied a robustness it could
  not provide.
- db: `create_tables()` now parses `CREATE TRIGGER ... BEGIN ... END;`.
  Splitting on the semicolons inside a trigger body handed SQLite a fragment
  and raised `OperationalError: incomplete input`. Nesting counts
  `BEGIN`/`CASE` against `END`, so a `CASE ... END` inside a body does not
  close it early and a bare `BEGIN;` is not mistaken for one.

### Documented

- transparency: `TransparencySettings` now states which fields the analyzer
  honours and which are orchestration hints for the calling application
  (`filtering_enabled`, `max_concurrent_analyses`, `cache_results` — the
  library analyses one document per call and does no filtering, threading,
  or caching of its own).
- transparency: `outcome_switching_detected` is documented as reserved and
  always `False`. Deciding it means comparing a trial's pre-registered
  primary outcomes against those reported; it is kept in the schema so
  persisted results need no migration when detection lands.

## [0.3.0]

Never released. The version string was bumped in-tree when embedding support
landed, but no release was cut; those changes ship as part of 0.4.0 above.

## [0.2.1] and earlier

No changelog was kept; see the git history.
