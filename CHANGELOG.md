# Changelog

All notable changes to bmlib are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); bmlib follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.3.0] — Unreleased

### Changed — breaking

- **`bmlib.db.transaction()` no longer commits when joining an open
  transaction** (SQLite savepoint path). Previously, a `transaction(conn)`
  block entered while the connection already held uncommitted writes would
  call `conn.commit()` on success, committing the caller's pending writes
  along with its own. Now the block joins via a savepoint and the owner of
  the enclosing transaction commits. Code that relied on `transaction()` as
  a durability checkpoint after bare `execute()` writes must commit
  explicitly (or wrap the whole batch in an outer `transaction()`). The same
  applies to `run_migrations()` when called with a transaction already open.
  On PostgreSQL the old connection-wide commit behaviour is unchanged (no
  savepoint nesting is implemented there).
- **`bmlib.publications.sync()` buffers each day's records and stores them
  after the fetch.** The `on_record` callback now fires while the fetcher
  streams, *before* the record is stored — callbacks must not expect to read
  the record back from the database. Writes cost one commit per day instead
  of one per statement, and SQLite's write lock is no longer held across
  network I/O; in exchange, a day's records are held in memory during the
  fetch.
- `TransparencyAnalyzer._check_europepmc()` now returns a 6-tuple (adds
  `industry_coi`).

### Added

- transparency: industry conflict-of-interest detection in full-text
  COI/disclosure statements — negation-aware, scoped to the COI region, with
  a guard for non-industry contexts (university/government employment,
  editorial boards). ORs into `industry_funding_detected` at moderate
  confidence (#7).
- llm: embedding support in the LLM abstraction layer (`LLMClient.embed()`,
  `EmbeddingResponse`).
- db: nested `transaction()` blocks on SQLite are now composable (savepoint
  join; the outer block owns the commit).
- llm: `bmlib.llm.json_repair` — repairs malformed LLM JSON (single quotes,
  trailing/missing commas, unescaped control chars, truncation, unquoted
  keys) via `repair_json()`, `safe_json_loads()`, `extract_and_repair_json()`.
  `BaseAgent.parse_json()` now uses it as a last-resort fallback. Ported from
  bmlibrarian.
- llm: `bmlib.llm.text_utils` — boundary-aware text chunking (`TextChunk`,
  `TextChunker`, `chunk_text`) that never drops text, plus map-reduce /
  rolling-summary long-document processing and document-text helpers. Ported
  and consolidated from bmlibrarian's two chunkers.
- quality: `bmlib.quality.cochrane_models` and `cochrane_formatter` —
  Cochrane-aligned nine-domain Risk-of-Bias models with judgement + rationale,
  the full study-characteristics table, and Markdown/HTML renderers. A strict
  superset of `BiasRisk`. Ported from bmlibrarian.
- quality: `bmlib.quality.extractors` and `scoring_models` — rule-based
  (LLM-free) study-type detection with exclusion-context guarding and
  sample-size scoring, producing `DimensionScore` audit trails. Ported from
  bmlibrarian's paper_weight.
- fulltext: `bmlib.fulltext.pdf_converter` — pluggable PDF→text conversion
  (`ConversionResult`, `PDFConverter`, `get_converter`, `list_converters`)
  with a PyMuPDF backend behind the new optional `bmlib[pdf]` extra. Ported
  from bmlibrarian.

### Fixed

- transparency: a JATS-tagged COI section now counts as `coi_disclosed=True`
  even when its wording contains no cue phrase — the tag is structural proof
  of a disclosure; the cue-phrase scan remains the fallback for untagged text
  (#13).
- llm: `list_models()` on the Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible providers now
  returns a copy of the cached model list; mutating a returned list no longer
  corrupts the cache for subsequent callers (#12).
- publications: batched database commits — one commit per stored publication
  and one per synced day instead of one per statement (#8).
- llm: `get_llm_client()` singleton creation is now thread-safe; the
  openai-compat `list_models()` caches a successful-but-empty response for
  the TTL instead of re-hitting the API every call; the Anthropic provider
  warns (once per model per instance) when an unknown model id falls back to
  estimated pricing (#9).
- fulltext: `FullTextCache` sanitizes identifiers internally, so a raw DOI or
  path-traversal string cannot write outside the cache directory;
  already-safe identifiers keep their exact filenames (#9).
- publications: the OpenAlex fetcher tolerates a `"meta": null` page instead
  of raising `AttributeError` (#9).
